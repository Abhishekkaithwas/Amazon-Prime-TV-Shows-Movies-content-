# Amazon Prime Video Content Analysis

## Project Overview

This project explores the Amazon Prime Video content library using data analysis and visualization techniques. The goal is to extract valuable insights into content diversity, regional availability, trends over time, and IMDb ratings to influence subscription growth, user engagement, and content investment strategies in the streaming industry.

## Dataset

The project utilizes two datasets:

- **titles.csv:** Contains information about movies and TV shows available on Amazon Prime, including title, type, description, release year, age certification, runtime, genres, production countries, IMDb ratings, and TMDb popularity scores.

## Methodology

The project follows these steps:

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning:** Libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and missingno are imported. The datasets are loaded, and data cleaning involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types for better analysis.
2. **Data Visualization and Storytelling:** Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses are performed using various charts and visualizations. Insights gained from each chart are discussed, along with their potential impact on business objectives.
3. **Key Findings:** The analysis reveals insights into content distribution, IMDb ratings, trends over time, runtime, and correlations between variables.
